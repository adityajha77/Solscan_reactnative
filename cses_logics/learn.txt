LEARN ABOUT STL LIBRARIES LIKE MAP , SETS , MULTI SETS , VECTOR , LISTS , UNORDERED LISTS ,PBDS(orderd set)   below are the explanations 


ORDERED_SET
order_of_key(k): This function returns the number of elements strictly smaller than a given key k in the ordered set.
find_by_order(k): This function returns an iterator to the k-th element (0-indexed) in the sorted set. 

KADANE'S ALGO RITHM TO FIND THE MAX SUM OF THE SUBARRAY

//use pairs if you want to sort the array and want to print the actual array positions

+1 and -1 logic in number line problems we get to know what are max value it goes and we can track

//jsoepg problem 2 of sorting 
//circular array things to keep in mind 
use mod to come back to proper position to handle out of bound 
//to use (position +index)%size
we want sorted array effective remove and mod logic 
best to use set but mod application can be there in set 
*** use PBDS GNU LIBRARY PROVIDE THIS ORDERED_SET ***
PROVIDE
find_by_order(idx);
and iterator; 
time complexity is logn;
also provide order_of_the_key(element)
only for c++
